=== 0.1.3
* Added rdfa-test-suite as sub-module and refactored RDFa tests to use them.
* Fix but in white-space separated attributes
* Downcase XHTML reserved words

=== 0.1.2
* Move most test-case logic into rdfa_helper.
* Separate approved and unreviewed tests.
* Allow for soft failure of unreviewed tests by catching Spec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError.
* Integrate rdfa-test-suite and create test cases in the same manner. (Causing SPARQL problems with XMLLiterals)

=== 0.1.1 / 2009-11-01
* Changes from rdfa_parser project.

=== 0.1.0 / 2008-12-02
